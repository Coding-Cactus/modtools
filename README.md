# [Repl Talk Moderation Tools](https://modtools.codingcactus.repl.co)
##### A few simple tools to make moderating repltalk that little bit easier!

A webapp for [Repl Talk](https://repl.it/talk) Moderators to use to aid them in the their protection of the repl talk forum.

### Current features
+ Admin Ban - Ban a user but also delete all of their posts and comments
+ Audit Logs - The official repl talk audit logs are pretty much useless, but these are readable and useful (no more need for manual logging! 🎉🎉)
+ Auto Action - No need to open 4 tabs just to deal with one thing, because with auto actions all you need to do is enter the type, id/username, and the infraction and all the work is done for you
